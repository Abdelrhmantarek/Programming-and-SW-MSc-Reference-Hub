#  ðŸ§  Programming-and-Software-Development - MSc Reference Hub ðŸš€
A collection of Python notebooks covering data acquisition, manipulation, visualization, text &amp; image processing, machine learning, deep learning (DNN, CNN, RNN, Transformers), and generative models. ðŸª„


Welcome to The Ultimate MSc Survival Guide (a.k.a. this GitHub repo)! ðŸŽ“ðŸ’» If you're diving into Programming and Software Development, youâ€™re in the right place. This repo is your one-stop shop for mastering Python, data wrangling, AI magic, and everything in betweenâ€”because debugging is 90% of our job, right?

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside?
ðŸ“Š Data Acquisition & Manipulation â€“ Because raw data is like unfiltered coffee: undrinkable.
ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization â€“ Turn numbers into art (or at least readable charts).
ðŸ”  Text Manipulation & Preprocessing â€“ Teaching machines to read without making them cry.
ðŸ–¼ Image Processing & Machine Learning â€“ Because pixels have feelings too.
ðŸ§  Deep Learning (DNN, CNN, RNN, Transformers) â€“ More layers than your winter wardrobe.
ðŸŽ¨ Generative Models â€“ Making AI creative (so we can finally take a break).

ðŸ¤– Whoâ€™s This For?
MSc students, researchers, data enthusiasts, and lost souls wondering why their code isnâ€™t running.
